# The Deo

## **What is it?** <a href="#2a2d" id="2a2d"></a>

The Deo will serve as the primary currency of Player 2. The name “Deo” is derived from the Greek word δύο (pronounced dýo) which means “two”. We also think the name “Deos” rolls off the tongue naturally and makes for a great currency name.

## **The Problem with Fiat Money** <a href="#cee6" id="cee6"></a>

Fiat money is money that is backed by the issuing government. It has no intrinsic value and is purely dependent on the stability of the government itself.

In the worst case scenario, the government can collapse entirely, rendering its money worthless. Or the government can print copious amounts of its money, also rendering its money essentially worthless; this has happened in many countries such as Hungary (1945), Zimbabwe (2007), and most recently Venezuela (2019). In these scenarios, entire life savings of their citizens were wiped out.

Barring extreme situations, even supposedly AAA money have seen their governments turn to excessive printing in times of duress. The biggest fiat currency in the world is the US Dollar, and between 2020–2021 the US Federal Reserve grew its balance sheet from about US$4 trillion to slightly north of US$8 trillion due to COVID-19. The result is the country experiencing its highest inflation in 40 years and that is likely only the beginning.

## **The Problem with Stablecoins** <a href="#96d5" id="96d5"></a>

Stablecoins are generally seen as a safe way to keep one’s assets in cryptocurrency without the risk of volatility. The biggest stablecoins today by market capitalization are USDT and USDC.

The unfortunate common denominator is that they are pegged to the US Dollar. While the US Dollar is less volatile than cryptocurrencies in general, we have established that fiat has many problems so that is not something we should be pegging our crypto assets to in the long run.

## **What should Good Money Look Like?** <a href="#a3f6" id="a3f6"></a>

If fiat money is not good, and stablecoins are not either, then what is?

The team believes that good money should have the following characteristics:

1. It cannot be counterfeited
2. It is widely accepted
3. It is fully backed
4. It has the ability to maintain purchasing power parity
5. It is inflation resistant

In short, good money is one that has stability in value; that means your money should be able to purchase goods and services from various places, and it should not be impacted by inflation.

While none of the traditional fiat currencies hold all these qualities, it is very possible to create such a currency using cryptography.

Cryptocurrencies inherently tackles point 1. As cryptocurrencies gain adoption, that will likely increase acceptance, taking care of point 2. This leaves the last three points.

## **The Deo as the Currency of the Future** <a href="#23e3" id="23e3"></a>

In order to fulfill both points 3 and 4, we endeavor to have the Deo collateralized by a reserve consisting of a basket of cryptocurrencies that broadly represents the crypto market.

As an example, let us assume that the crypto market only consists of three cryptocurrencies and they are C1, C2, and C3. Based on their dominance, we can give each of them their respective weight. Let us assume that C1 commands 50% of the market, while C2 and C3 commands 25% each. Our Deos would then be backed by 50% C1, 25% C2, and 25% C3. With this backing we can create a peg between our Deos and the basket of cryptocurrencies.

With the peg setup, the core job of the reserve would then be to keep the peg within a small range. If demand for the Deo rises, then the Deo would trade at a premium to the peg. The reserve can then mint new Deos, and purchase the basket of cryptocurrencies. This does two things:\
1\) Allowing the newly minted Deos to be properly collateralized and\
2\) Bringing the Deo price back to its peg.

Conversely, if demand for the Deo falls, the reserve can buy back Deos from the open market and sell the equivalent value from their basket of cryptocurrencies. The Deos that were purchased will then be burnt. This brings the Deo back to its peg while still maintaining the correct collateralization.

With this setup, the Deos will always be fully backed; and since the Deos are collateralized and pegged, it ensures that the Deo always maintains purchasing power parity relative to the market.

Last but not least, the Deo will be inflation resistant. Since no new Deos are minted without proper collateralization, the value of Deos will never decrease. And since purchasing power parity is maintained, the same goods and services will always cost the same amount of Deos throughout time. This makes the Deo the textbook definition of a store of value.

Our design allows for four of the five characteristics to be fulfilled, but whether the Deo becomes widely accepted is something we have to work hard on. However, should the Deos become widely accepted, it will fulfill all five points, **making the Deo the perfect money**.

Now that we know what perfect money looks like, the question is how do we get there? Well, that is another story for another day!
