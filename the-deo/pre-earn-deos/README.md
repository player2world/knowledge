# Pre-earn DEOs

At Player 2 we often ask **why not**: Why can’t we do things differently? Why are things done in a certain way? _Is there a better way?_ This mindset led us to the creation of DeFi 2.1, but it also led us to think critically on every aspect of our project.

Currently most projects launch their tokens by creating attractive yield farms. Unfortunately this means giving large amounts of their tokens to users who are likely not interested in the project. These “mercenary users” are simply lending their money to farm a quick profit then exiting once a more attractive farm appears.&#x20;

We think this is a flawed way to launch and a huge waste of tokens. So instead, we have decided to give **you the Players** these rewards!&#x20;

This is our way of doing things differently. We want to give **** you the opportunity to earn our DEOs fairly. Early supporters like yourselves are key to helping Player 2 grow, and we want to reward you for it.&#x20;

So what does this mean for you?&#x20;

We will be launching outreach programs, Twitter raids, engagement contests, art submissions and more. We have earmarked a good chunk of DEOs to be given to our Player 2 community.&#x20;

We will track your DEOs on a public dashboard as we go:\

Your DEOs will be released linearly a month after our IDO.
