_What makes Player 2 different?_&#x20;

**Products.**&#x20;

We've been building since Oct 2021, and we've been live on [#Solana](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Solana?src=hashtag\_click) mainnet since Mar 2022.&#x20;

Yeah... It's been a while...

We launched a mini [#DeFi](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeFi?src=hashtag\_click) ecosystem in a building we call the "Financial Brewery". The Brewery is where we cook up novel financial products! Our first protocol is called the Bitcoin Accumulator and it gives holders more [$BTC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC\&src=cashtag\_click) through the capturing of market inefficiencies. Unfortunately we had to sunset this in the wake of FTX's collapse. Read more [here](../the-bitcoin-accumulator/).

Since then we've also launched [elemental](../businesses/elemental/ "mention"), [liquidation-free-loans.md](../businesses/liquidation-free-loans.md "mention"), and [sophie-ai.md](../businesses/sophie-ai.md "mention").

**Buy products, not promises.**

Hold projects to a higher standard. You HAVE the power: Vote with your wallets. Make teams deliver before you patronize them. This is how we push the space forward!
