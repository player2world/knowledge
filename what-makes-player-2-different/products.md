_What makes Player 2 different?_&#x20;

**Products.**&#x20;

We've been building since Oct 2021, and we've been live on [#Solana](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Solana?src=hashtag\_click) mainnet since Mar 2022.&#x20;

Yeah... It's been a while...

We launched a mini [#DeFi](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeFi?src=hashtag\_click) ecosystem in a building we call the "Financial Brewery". The Brewery is where we cook up novel financial products! Our first protocol is called the Bitcoin Accumulator and it gives holders more [$BTC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC\&src=cashtag\_click) through the capturing of market inefficiencies.

We also wanted to give Players the convenience under one roof, so we also built the requisite [#DeFi](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeFi?src=hashtag\_click) functions.&#x20;

In our Brewery you'll be able to:

\- Swap&#x20;

\- Add liquidity&#x20;

\- Buy bonds&#x20;

\- And upgrade to our Bitcoin Accumulator&#x20;

All with the help of fun NPC characters!
