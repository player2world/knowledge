_What makes Player 2 different?_&#x20;

**Stickiness.**&#x20;

People in web 3 hop around. And rightfully so as most dApps only offer a single utility.

Everything you need, in one world. And this isn’t JUST a convenience factor, it allows for SYNERGY like you’ve never seen before.

**Bonus:** Think of the tech companies that made it big.&#x20;

Many of them today provide a whole ecosystem of products under one roof. This is again, convenience and synergy.&#x20;
