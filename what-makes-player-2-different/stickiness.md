# Stickiness

_What makes Player 2 different?_&#x20;

**Stickiness.**&#x20;

People in web 3 hop around. And rightfully so as most projects only offer a single utility.

We’re going to provide all of the basic DeFi infrastructure (and more) on one platform. **We’re going to operate like a quasi L2.**&#x20;

Everything you need, in one world. And this isn’t JUST a convenience factor, it allows for SYNERGY like you’ve never seen before.

Think of web 2 tech companies that made it big (Google, Amazon, etc).&#x20;

Many of them provide a whole ecosystem of products under one roof. This is again, convenience and synergy.&#x20;
