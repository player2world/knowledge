# The Problem

## The Problem

Whether you're a developer or a user, **onboarding on Solana is not easy.**

## Current Onboarding

#### Developers&#x20;

Onboard primarily through hackathons and typically only know a handful of people who likely won't have all the answers.

#### Users

Onboard mainly via a project that achieved sufficient hype. It's most likely an NFT project at this point, many of which are unsustainable/rugs. They have little to no knowledge of the majority of the Solana ecosystem.

## The Result

#### Developers

Don't know where to ask questions and may leave Solana if they are unable to find answers and make progress.

#### Users

Never truly understand what Solana has to offer. They are likely to hop onto other hype NFT projects, eventually hit a rug, then leave.
