# P2 Sophie

#### <mark style="color:red;">As we reached mid-2023, we made the strategic decision to sunset P2 Sophie. This decision came in light of the groundbreaking advancements and global impact of ChatGPT. Our team takes immense pride in having launched Sophie prior to ChatGPT's public debut. However, we've realized that competing with the rapid pace and extensive resources of larger tech giants is not something our team is able to do.</mark>

## Meet Sophie!

P2 Sophie is an intelligent, family-friendly AI chatbot. She helps communities greatly improve their onboarding experience by responding automatically with helpful answers in the chat.

Sophie can be best described as a synthetic intelligence with a natural language processor. This allows her to understand and respond to human language. She is multi-lingual, can chat 1-on-1, in a group, loves playing games, teasing people, and is a little bit sassy!

Her ability to group chat and banter makes her a positive presence in any community. She helps users have fun, all while building rapport and community stickiness at the same time.
