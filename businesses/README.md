# Businesses

There are many projects in our crypto space. In Player 2, we call projects "businesses".

Player 2 is built to help discoverability. We want to help Players discover the many wonderful project that exists in our ecosystem. And we think **a fun way** to do it is via our **gamified world!**

Businesses may be native to Player 2, or exist as a simple storefront that links to their own site.

This section features the native businesses that are active or being built on Player 2.

All businesses pay a 5% sales tax that will be used to buyback DEO.
