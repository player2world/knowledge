# Aqueous Fund

## Aqueous Fund (28% APR)

The Aqueous Fund is Elemental's flagship fund on Solana, designed to offer the highest capital-protected, risk-adjusted returns for investors.

As an actively managed fund, Aqueous generates returns primarily through yield farming and arbitrage opportunities on Solana DeFi, operating 100% transparently on-chain. With fixed yields that represent true yields, Aqueous offers a simple and transparent investment option without any hidden fees or costs. The fund auto-compounds a portion of its gains, enabling it to grow its annual percentage rate (APR) over time. With a constant stream of income, Aqueous provides investors with the opportunity to earn passive income on their $SOL holdings.

Like a stream of water, this fund offers a constant stream of income. But also like water, the USD notional value of your income will ebb and flow since Aqueous pays in $SOL.
