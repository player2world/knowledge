# Tidal Fund

## Tidal Fund (13% APR)

The Tidal Fund provides capital protection, risk-adjusted returns, and accessibility to all.

Managed actively, Tidal generates returns through yield farming and arbitrage opportunities on Solana DeFi, operating with full transparency on the blockchain. With fixed yields that represent true yields, Tidal provides a simple and transparent investment option without hidden fees or costs.

Investing in Tidal provides a constant stream of income and allows investors to earn passive income on their SOL holdings. Just like how the ocean's tide rises and falls based on the movements of the sun and moon, the fund's yields will also vary depending on the availability of opportunities on Solana DeFi.

_Key Risk: Protocols getting hacked._
