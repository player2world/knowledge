# Granite Fund

## Granite Fund (36% APR)

The Granite Fund is Elemental's flagship USDC fund, designed to offer the highest capital-protected, risk-adjusted returns for investors.

As an actively managed fund, Granite generates returns primarily through yield farming and arbitrage opportunities on Solana DeFi, operating 100% transparently on-chain. With fixed yields that represent true yields, Granite offers a simple and transparent investment option without any hidden fees or costs. The fund auto-compounds a portion of its gains, enabling it to grow its annual percentage rate (APR) over time. With a constant stream of income, Granite provides investors with the opportunity to earn passive income on their USDC holdings.

Drawing inspiration from a stone that is fundamental to the earthâ€™s core, the Granite Fund stands as the cornerstone of Elemental.

_Key Risk: Various stablecoins depegging, oracle issues, protocols getting exploited._
