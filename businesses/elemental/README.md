# Elemental

Elemental DeFi is the **first fixed-yield fund on Solana**.

It is an actively managed fund that captures yield purely from Solana DeFi; this means it operates 100% on-chain, and is 100% transparent. It features a $SOL based fund (Aqueous) and a $USDC based fund (Granite).

## Aqueous Fund (28% APR)

The Aqueus Fund is our flagship fund which produces yields in SOL.

It invests in a spectrum of yield opportunities across the Solana ecosystem. The overall fund maintains medium risk.

Like a stream of water, this fund offers a constant stream of income. But also like water, the USD notional value of your income will ebb and flow since Aqueous pays in SOL.

_Key Risks: Protocols getting hacked._

## Granite Fund (14% APR)

The Granite Fund produces yield in USDC.

It maintains its USD notional value by holding only stablecoins and delta neutral products.

Granite is a ubiquitous stone found in bedrock, and this fund aims to be the bedrock of Elemental; strong and reliable.

_Key Risks: Stablecoins devaluing._
