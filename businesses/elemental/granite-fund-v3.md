# Granite Fund V3

## Granite Fund (14% APR)

The Granite Fund is Elemental's other flagship fund and it produces fixed-yields in $USDC. The fund auto-compounds a portion of its gains, thereby allowing it to grow its APR over time.

It invests in various opportunities across the Solana ecosystem, with the overall fund maintaining low-medium risk.

Granite is a ubiquitous stone found in bedrock, and this fund aims to be the bedrock of Elemental; strong and reliable.

_Key Risk: Stablecoins devaluing, oracle issues._
