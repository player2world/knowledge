# Loam Fund V3

## Loam Fund (7% APR)

The Loam Fund is a publicly accessible fund. Unlike the gated funds, Loam will have a growing deposit capacity, allowing many to participate. However because of this, it will not have the compounding feature that is cornerstone to our flagship funds.

Loam invests in various opportunities across the Solana ecosystem, with the overall fund maintaining low-medium risk.

Loam is a type of soil that is full of nutrients and has a texture that retains just the right amount of water. It is ideal for gardening and agricultural uses. As a USDC fund, we envision this fertile fund to be the stable base that helps to grow your portfolio steadily.

_Key Risk: Stablecoins devaluing, oracle issues._
