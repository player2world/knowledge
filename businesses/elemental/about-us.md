# About Us

Elemental DeFi helps you find the highest capital protected, risk-adjusted returns on Solana.

Our goal is to make passive income simple, so users only need to deposit, and Elemental takes care of the rest. We are an actively managed fund that generates returns primarily via yield farming and arbitrage opportunities. Elemental does this purely from Solana DeFi, operating transparently 100% on-chain.

To keep things simple, Elemental offers **fixed yields; the first on Solana**. Also, unlike most protocols, our yields are **true yields**. Elemental does not have any hidden fees or costs. The yield number represents the true yield you will receive.

## History

#### V3: Launched 20 Nov 2022

Elemental becomes the first fund on Solana to allow a fixed-yield return. While the yields may be gradually adjusted over longer periods, they are fixed within each [Elemental Epoch](elemental-epoch.md) of 5 days. This is made possible by the introduction of a buffer fund which acts as a cushion to absorb volatility.

#### **V2: Launched 02 Oct 2022**

The V2 system coincided with the launch of our first $USDC fund and introduced the concept of a compound and insurance fund. The compound fund allows for Elemental to steadily grow its yield over time, and the insurance fund provides users some recovery value in the face of adversity.

#### V1: Launched 09 Sep 2022

Elemental launched with a handful of users with just 100 $SOL. This V1 system was largely exploratory with extremely erratic returns of varying durations. It however still achieved a fairly impressive 18.23% annualized yield and proved that the fund can be a viable product.
