# About Us

Elemental makes investing simple for users, while also allowing them to access all of Solana DeFi. Through our platform, users are able to invest in different funds that are running different strategies across Solana. Since these are actively managed funds, all users need to do is deposit, and they'll start earning; hence our slogan: Passive income made simple.

## History

#### V4: Submitted to Solana's Grizzlython on 14 Mar 2023

Elemental is evolving yet again! More details to come.

#### V3: Launched 20 Nov 2022

Elemental becomes the first fund on Solana to allow a fixed-yield return. While the yields may be gradually adjusted over longer periods, they are fixed within each [Elemental Epoch](elemental-epoch.md) of 5 days. This is made possible by the introduction of a buffer fund which acts as a cushion to absorb volatility.

#### **V2: Launched 02 Oct 2022**

The V2 system coincided with the launch of our first $USDC fund and introduced the concept of a compound and insurance fund. The compound fund allows for Elemental to steadily grow its yield over time, and the insurance fund provides users some recovery value in the face of adversity.

#### V1: Launched 09 Sep 2022

Elemental launched with a handful of users with just 100 $SOL. This V1 system was largely exploratory with extremely erratic returns of varying durations. It however still achieved a fairly impressive 18.23% annualized yield and proved that the fund can be a viable product.
