# About Us

Elemental DeFi is the **first fixed-yield fund on Solana**.

It is an actively managed fund that generates returns primarily via yield farming and arbitrage opportunities. Elemental does this purely from Solana DeFi, operating transparently 100% on-chain.

## History

#### V3: Launched 20 Nov 2022

Elemental becomes the first fund on Solana to allow a fixed-yield return. While the yields may be gradually adjusted over longer periods, they are fixed within each [Elemental Epoch](elemental-epoch.md) of 5 days. This is made possible by the introduction of a buffer fund which acts as a cushion to absorb volatility.

#### **V2: Launched 02 Oct 2022**

The V2 system introduced the compound and insurance funds. These additions meant Elemental can steadily grow its yield over time, and provide users some recovery value in the face of adversity.

#### V1: Launched 09 Sep 2022

Elemental launched with a handful of users with just 100 $SOL. This V1 system was largely exploratory with extremely erratic returns of varying durations. It however still achieved a fairly impressive 18.23% annualized yield and proved that the fund can be a viable product.
