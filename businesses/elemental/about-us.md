# About Us

Elemental DeFi is the **first fixed-yield fund on Solana**.

It is an actively managed fund that generates revenue via yield farming and arbitrage opportunities. Elemental does this purely from Solana DeFi; this means it operates 100% on-chain, and is 100% transparent.&#x20;

Elemental first launched on 9 Sep 2022 with 100 $SOL. It has since grown and is currently running on its V3 system.

You may contact Elemental via their dedicated #elemental channel on the Player 2 discord, or tweet them at @elementaldefi.
