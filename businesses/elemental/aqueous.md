# Aqueous Fund

## Aqueous Fund (28% APR)

Aqueous, Elemental's pioneering fund, has set the standard from the outset. With its unwavering delivery of high fixed yields, it stands as a beacon of our commitment to passive income. The Aqueous Fund masterfully melds consistency with innovation, presenting a realm of opportunity for investors.

As an actively managed fund, Aqueous generates returns primarily through yield farming and arbitrage opportunities on Solana DeFi, operating 100% transparently on-chain. With fixed yields that represent true yields, Aqueous offers a simple and transparent investment option without any hidden fees or costs. The fund auto-compounds a portion of its gains, enabling it to grow its annual percentage rate (APR) over time. With a constant stream of income, Aqueous provides investors with the opportunity to earn passive income on their SOL holdings.
