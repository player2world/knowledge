# Aqueous Fund V3

## Aqueous Fund (28% APR)

The Aqueous Fund is Elemental's flagship fund which produces fixed-yields in $SOL.

It invests in various opportunities across the Solana ecosystem, with the overall fund maintaining medium risk.

Like a stream of water, this fund offers a constant stream of income. But also like water, the USD notional value of your income will ebb and flow since Aqueous pays in $SOL.

_Key Risk: Protocols getting hacked._
