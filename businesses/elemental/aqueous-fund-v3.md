# Aqueous Fund V3

## Aqueous Fund (28% APR)

The Aqueous Fund is Elemental's flagship fund which produces fixed-yields in $SOL.

Aqueous helps you find the highest capital protected, risk-adjusted returns on Solana. We are an actively managed fund that generates returns primarily via yield farming and arbitrage opportunities. We do this purely from Solana DeFi, operating transparently 100% on-chain.

To keep things simple, Aqueous offers **fixed yields; the first on Solana**. Also, unlike most protocols, our yields are **true yields**. Aqueous does not have any hidden fees or costs. The yield number represents the true yield you will receive.

The fund auto-compounds a portion of its gains, thereby allowing it to grow its APR over time.

Like a stream of water, this fund offers a constant stream of income. But also like water, the USD notional value of your income will ebb and flow since Aqueous pays in $SOL.

_Key Risk: Protocols getting hacked._
