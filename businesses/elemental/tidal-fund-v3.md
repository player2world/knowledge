# Tidal Fund V3

## Tidal Fund (13% APR)

The Tidal Fund is a publicly accessible fund. Unlike the gated funds, Tidal will have a growing deposit capacity, allowing many to participate. However because of this, it will not have the compounding feature that is cornerstone to our flagship funds.

Tidal invests in various opportunities across the Solana ecosystem, with the overall fund maintaining medium risk.

The ocean, like this fund, is accessible to all. And just like how the ocean's tide rises and falls based on the movements of the sun and moon, the fund yields will also rise and fall depending on what is available on Solana DeFi.&#x20;

_Key Risk: Protocols getting hacked._
