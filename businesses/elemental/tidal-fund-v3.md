# Tidal Fund V3

## Tidal Fund (13% APR)

The Tidal Fund is Elemental's first publicly accessible fund. Unlike the gated funds, Tidal will have a large deposit capacity, allowing many to participate.

It invests in various opportunities across the Solana ecosystem, with the overall fund maintaining low-medium risk.

The ocean, like this fund, is accessible to all. And just like how the ocean's tide rises and falls based on the movements of the sun and moon, the fund yields will also rise and fall depending on what is available on Solana DeFi.&#x20;

_Key Risk: Protocols getting hacked._
