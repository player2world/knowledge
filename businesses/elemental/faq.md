# FAQ

**Q: Where do the yields come from?**

A: From DeFi protocols across Solana. The Solana ecosystem is vast, and there are many yield opportunities. They are however in a constant flux, hold different risk profiles, and require close monitoring.

**Q: Are the yields sustainable?**

A: Since we derive yields outside of Elemental, they are sustainable so long as such sources exist. However, the number will fluctuate depending on what is available on Solana. We expect these numbers to shrink as the markets become more efficient.

**Q: How are you able to give a fixed yield then?**

A: We maintain a buffer pool. While the yields we earn fluctuate, the buffer pool will absorb the volatility. While the yield is fixed for the current Elemental Epoch, the yield may be adjusted over longer periods of time. We endeavor to make adjustments as infrequent as possible.

**Q: Elemental Epoch?**

A: We have our own epoch duration of 5 days. Please refer to the previous pages for the schedule.

**Q: When can I deposit?**

A: If the fund is not at maximum capacity, you may deposit anytime. But your funds will only be activated in the next epoch.

**Q: When can I withdraw?**

A: You may initiate a withdraw anytime. But your funds will need to complete an entire epoch after you initiate your withdrawal. For example, if you initiate a withdrawal on 4 Dec, you will need to wait for the full 5 Dec - 10 Dec epoch to complete; your funds will be available on 10 Dec. This delay is necessary for us to wind down more complex positions that may require a few days.

**Q: Is the yield expected to drop over the long run?**

A: Not necessarily, and quite possibly the opposite. We compound a portion of our gains. This means ceteris paribus, our yields should rise steadily over time.

**Q: Can you lose money?**

A: Yes. All investments carry risk. The protocols we invest in may get hacked, stablecoins may devalue, and more. However, we do our best to seek the best risk-adjusted returns, and diversify our portfolio to segment the risks. Barring such events, our funds should have full capital preservation.

**Q: What happens if you lose money?**

A: Our funds will still produce yield, albeit smaller. Since our funds also compound, they will regrow. We also have our buffer pool which we are looking to grow over time.

**Q: Can I lose my deposit?**

A: Yes, but not so easily. For you to lose a portion of your deposit, we will have to exhaust our own main funds, our compound funds, and the buffer funds. The buffer pool will also act as an insurance fund; it will only invest its $SOL in native Solana staking, and its $USDC will remain uninvested. This ensures the buffer pool does not take on **any** external protocol risk.

**Q: What's in it for you?**

After paying the yields, Player 2 sales tax, adding to the buffer pool, and reinvesting some for compound growth, we keep the remaining profits for ourselves.

**Q: I'm convinced! How do I get in?**

A: Purchase a Farmer NFT, get verified, and drop us a note in our #elemental channel on Discord. In the future, we will be releasing our own Elemental NFTs that will serve as your access pass.
