# tl;dr

1\) **Player 2 is a gamified world for communities and businesses to meet.** Our platform provides the means for new projects (which we call [businesses](../businesses/)) to launch. These businesses automatically gain visibility within our community. Player 2 focuses on businesses that provide true value - it should provide products or services that people are happy to pay for. This brings genuine revenue into the ecosystem.

2\) **All businesses pay a 5% sales tax.** In exchange for the launch platform and ready community base, businesses must conduct all sales in $DEO and pay a 5% sales tax. This tax gets used to buy and burn $DEO, thereby reducing its supply.

3\) **The** [**$DEO**](../deo/) **is backed by a reserve of $USDC, which keeps growing.** Aside from the supply reduction through taxes, Player 2 channels a portion of its own revenue to growing the reserve. We call these two mechanisms our "Twin Engines" and they are how the intrinsic value $DEOs will continue to rise over time.
