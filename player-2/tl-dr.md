# tl;dr

## Player 2

Player 2 helps you discover Solana through a gamifield world. It's where communities and businesses to meet, and it's powerd by a USDC backed economy.

## 1) **Discovery through a Gamified World**

Our platform enables the launch of new projects, which we refer to as [businesses](../businesses/), in a unique and engaging way. Businesses are represented as Non-Player Characters (NPCs) or buildings in a our gamified world, providing a fun and immersive experience for users.

These businesses should offer true value - products or services that people are willing to pay for. This contributes to the ecosystem by generating genuine revenue.

## 2) $DEO: A Token with Real Intrinsic Value

The $DEO token is the beating heart of our platform, and it's unlike any other token out there. Backed by a reserve of $USDC, $DEO has real intrinsic value that sets it apart from the rest. This backing gives $DEO the ability to withstand even the harshest bear markets, providing a high level of security and stability.

Furthermore, because $DEO has intrinsic value, it offers an asymmetrical risk profile. With limited downside risk and unlimited upside potential, $DEO is a token with an unmatched risk-reward ratio.

## 3) The Twin Engines: A Perpetual Force for Increasing Intrinsic Value over Time

At our platform, we believe in the power of intrinsic value. But we also know that value can't just sit there - it needs to grow over time. That's why we've developed two powerful mechanisms that we call the Twin Engines to drive the intrinsic value of $DEO to new heights.

The first engine is the global 5% tax, which all businesses pay in exchange for access to our supportive community. This tax gets used to buy and burn $DEO, reducing the token supply and increasing its scarcity. This helps to drive up the value of $DEO over time, creating a deflationary effect that benefits everyone in the ecosystem.

The second engine is our revenue share. Player 2 channels a portion of their revenue into growing the reserve, increasing the backing per token. This helps to create a virtuous cycle where the intrinsic value of $DEO grows over time, benefiting both businesses and investors alike.
