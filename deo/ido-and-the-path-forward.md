# IDO and the Path Forward

## Greetings Players,

2022 has been a rough year for crypto. The market saw a steady decline with two large "black swan" events (Terra and FTX) nuking the already depressed sentiments and destroying billions of collective wealth in the process.

But today is not about what we can't control. Today is about what we can. **Today we chart the path forward.**&#x20;

Player 2 will continue to build. Because that future that we all desire isn't going to build itself. If we want mass adoption, if we want that bull market to return, we have to create the conditions for it.

To those who are still around, we salute you and we thank you. You are what makes this road less lonely, and you are what gives us hope.

So where do we go from here?

Let me walk you through our battleplan.

## IDO

We recently conducted a vote on our IDO date. The official tally came in at 22 to 87, where most of you voted to postpone our IDO to January 2023. We shall carry out the will of the people.

Our tentative IDO date shall be **11 January 2023**.

The IDO price shall be $0.10, and those who are holding our Farmer NFTs will be granted access.

Barring any extreme events, we will proceed with the IDO. As the $DEO is a central piece of our Player 2 ecosystem, we should get it out there sooner than later.

## $DEO Burn

Even without the IDO, there is nothing stopping us from achieving our $DEO burn. This "burn" mechanism is one of our two twin engines that will help to increase the intrinsic value per $DEO.&#x20;

We have two live businesses at the moment, and they have already set aside funds to burn $DEOs the moment it is possible. This head start is a nice silver lining and is much welcomed. This also means the true backing per $DEO is now >$0.10.

## Focus

We need to be **very** conscious about what we deploy. If something doesn't smell like it would be a success, it is better to not deploy. And if we've launched something that isn't gaining traction, it's better to sunset it. If we keep repeating this process, we'll end up with a suite of very useful products that people are **happy to use**, and that **we can generate a profit from**.

Given that we are in a bear market, and we'll likely be in one for at least a year, we'll focus on products that people would want to use in a prolonged bear market.

Take for example [elemental](../businesses/elemental/ "mention"). Is it a product people would want to use in a bear? YES. Would MORE people want to use it if we opened it up further? YES. Do we make money from it? YES. Fantastic product.

Another one is [liquidation-free-loans.md](../businesses/liquidation-free-loans.md "mention"). Would people want to use in a bear? YES. Would new people buying our NFTs want to also use it? YES. Do we make money from it? YES. Fantastic product.

## Growth

As you have read from above, we will grow our Player 2 economy via launching multiple products. This means each new Player joining us becomes increasingly more impactful over time. At first a Player might be a user of 2 products. But as the ecosystem grows, he or she may use 3, then 4, etc. But it is not just more products being available, it is also the products being **synergistic**.

For example: Right now you can take a $USDC loan off your NFT at a 12% interest rate. Then you can take the $USDC and invest into Elemental for a 14% yield. That's a free 2%. This is **our version of "staking"**. While most projects give you a likely worthless token, **we give you $USDC**.

And what's more? Since all businesses pay taxes, they grow our **collective bags.** This happens because taxes get used to buy and burn $DEO, which in turn will start to appreciate. Just by doing the above, you are supporting two different businesses that are paying a 5% $DEO tax.

## Farmer NFTs

Why buy? Why hold?

You can use them to get a loan, sure. But that is NOT the main point.&#x20;

The **main point** of the Farmers is you are indirectly **buying 100 $DEOs**. Everything else are minor perks but **largely irrelevant**.

The question you need to ask yourself is this: **Do you think that 100 DEOs is worth holding onto?**&#x20;

If the answer is no, **sell it**. If the answer is yes, then **hold, or buy more**. I'm buying more (NFA). I still feel underexposed. And this is because I know how crazy Player 2 will get when we **continue piecing more pieces together**.

## The Path Forward

We'll continue our "open building", and we'll be fast on deploying and sunsetting projects (if necessary).

If you want a direct impact at growing your bags, give us feedback during the build process. We are building in the open **because we want feedback**. The more feedback we have, the better products we can produce, and the faster our collective bags will grow.&#x20;

Want to go a step further? Help figure out what people might want to use and pay for during this bear. Then validate it - do polls, focused groups, curate comments from around. We can use your ideas to improve existing products or create new ones entirely.

**This is how we make during the bear**. And this is how we ready our ship to ride the wave in the next bull run.

Game on.
