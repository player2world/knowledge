# IDO and the Path Forward

2022 has been a rough year for crypto. The market saw a steady decline with two large "black swan" events (Terra and FTX) nuking the already depressed sentiments and destroying billions of collective wealth in the process.

But today is not about what we can't control. Today is about what we can. **Today we chart the path forward.**&#x20;

Player 2 will continue to build. Because that future that we all desire isn't going to build itself. If we want mass adoption, if we want that bull market to return, we have to create the conditions for it.

To those who are still around, we salute you and we thank you. You are what makes this road less lonely, and you are what gives us hope.

So where do we go from here?

Let me walk you through our battleplan.

## IDO

We recently conducted a vote on our IDO date. The official tally came in at 22 to 87, where most of you voted to postpone our IDO to January 2023. We shall carry out the will of the people.

Our tentative IDO date shall be **11 January 2023**.

The IDO price shall be $0.10, and those who are holding our Farmer NFTs will be granted access.

Barring any extreme events, we will proceed with the IDO. As the $DEO is a central piece of our Player 2 ecosystem, we should get it out there sooner than later.

## $DEO Burn

Even without the IDO, there is nothing stopping us from achieving our $DEO burn. This "burn" mechanism is one of our two twin engines that will help to increase the intrinsic value per $DEO.&#x20;

We have two live businesses at the moment, and they have already set aside funds to burn $DEOs the moment it is possible. This head start is a nice silver lining and is much welcomed. This also means the true backing per $DEO is now >$0.10.
