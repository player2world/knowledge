#### Dandi the Farmer

Type: Farmer

Location: Future Farms

Our Dandi farmers are an industrious lot, and think they have the greatest jobs in the world. They can be a cheeky bunch, and love to mess up the books in Winterrose’s library. Dandis’ drink of choice is typically carrot juice.

**What is Rarity?**\
Farmers come with a "rarity tag". Our rarity metric is a **simplistic way** of assessing how strong some of your Farmers' stats are. They are not fully indicative how effective your Farmers will be in the game. Different people will prioritize different stats based on their preferences, so the best way is to look at the raw stats themselves.

**Rarity Calculations**\
Mythical: 4 or more very strong stats\
Rare: 3 very strong stats\
Uncommon: 2 very strong stats\
Common: 1 or 0 very strong stat

**What equals a very strong stat?**\
We consider these ranges to be very strong: \
Energy Max: 1450-1500 \
Energy Expenditure: 5-7 \
Mood Max: 1450-1500 \
Mood Expenditure: 5-7 \
Yield Multiplier: 9-10% \
Harvest Capacity: 11-12 \
Luck: 9-10%

Though in general, a "rare" should outperform a "common", you could get a scenario where a "common" may have almost all its stats very close to the top range, but not quite there. This Farmer may be way more effective in game than a "rare" Farmer who may have 3 strong stats, but extremely weak in all the others.
