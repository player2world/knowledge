# The Bitcoin Accumulator

#### Please note that the Bitcoin Accumulator has been deprecated as of 15 November 2022 due to the collapse of Sollet BTC ($soBTC).&#x20;

$soBTC was the dominant Bitcoin token on Solana at that time, and the token was unfortunately the underlying asset of the Bitcoin Accumulator. $soBTC was minted by the Sollet bridge which was operated by FTX. The bridge ceased to function after FTX declared bankruptcy.

More details are in our official statement below.
