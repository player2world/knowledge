# Bitcoin Accumulator Liquidity Pools

### **Genesis Liquidity Pool**

The wrBTC-USDC liquidity pool is our genesis pool. You may add/remove to/from this pool by looking for PC-07 in our Financial Brewery.

### **Future Liquidity Pools**

As the Bitcoin Accumulator grows, Player 2 may add additional liquidity pools. This may include pools for the BTCA tokens.

### Shallow Liquidity

Generally most projects would prefer a deep liquidity pool for their token. However, as the Bitcoin Accumulator captures value from market inefficiencies, it does better with higher volatility tokens. This means that the protocol does better with a shallow liquidity pool.
