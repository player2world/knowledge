# Bitcoin Accumulator Treasury

To ensure that the wrBTC backing will always remain the same, the Bitcoin Accumulator Treasury will comprise purely of Bitcoins (BTCs).

Our wrBTC is always backed 1:1 with BTC, that means if we have 10 wrBTCs in circulation, there will be 10 BTCs in the treasury.

Should the treasury grow to a sizable figure, Player 2 may deploy it to further enhance the protocol's yield. This includes possibly creating Player 2's own lending platform.
