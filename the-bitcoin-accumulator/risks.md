# Risks

There are risks to every crypto project and our Bitcoin Accumulator is no different.

Aside from the usual security risks that crypto projects have, there are two additional risks that are unique to our Bitcoin Accumulator.

#### 1) The price of Bitcoin will likely impact your investment.

The underlying asset of all the Bitcoin Accumulator tokens is Bitcoin; by purchasing any of the tokens, you are indirectly taking on the price risk of Bitcoin. This means if Bitcoin loses value, the Bitcoin Accumulator tokens will likely lose value too.

#### 2) Buying wrBTC when it is trading significantly above BTC is highly risky.

Since wrBTC is backed but not pegged, it may trade significantly above BTC. Since the protocol incentivizes wrBTC and BTC to trade at par, the wrBTC price is likely to correct over time.
