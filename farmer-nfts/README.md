# Farmer NFTs

Looking to mint our Farmer NFTs? You've come to the right place! Here's the FAQ.

Q: What is it?

A: A utility NFT for our Player 2 world. It will act as an access pass to our game. It can be upgraded, and it will allow you to farm our many tokens.

Q: Why should I care?

A: Tired of ponzinomics? Tired of coins and NFTs with no intrinsic value? \
We've solved them both. Our project has real revenue and our tokens are backed with collateral. We're bear market proof. We're the new meta. We're the #valuemeta.

Q: How many will be available?

A: We'll be releasing our Genesis Series that will feature our first two farmers Dandi and Nettly with a total supply of 2x10,000 NFTs.

Q: How much will it cost?

A: Between 10-20 USDC. The amount will be confirmed closer to the mint date. \
They are priced affordably for accessibility.

Q: I don't like my NFT. Can I get a refund?

A: Good joke. But yes you can. We did say all our tokens are collateralized - we weren't kidding. Once our game launches, there will be an in-game feature to burn your NFT.

Q: What's the secret?

A: The secret is: **Don't be greedy.** Unlike other projects, we don't spend the mint funds - those go straight into our reserve that will be used to honor the burns. Additionally, as the game grows, so does the reserve and this is how Players all win together.

Q: There must be a trick. Your game is going to take a year to launch!

A: No it's actually almost done. We've been building in stealth for 9 months and the game should be out \~2 months after our mint.

Q: Ok I'm convinced. How do I purchase one of these "NFTs"?

A: Get on our whitelist. Each whitelist spot grants you 2 mints.\
Here are 5 ways: \
1\) Invest in our Bitcoin Accumulator product\
2\) Pass our Knowledge Quiz\
3\) Have genuine conversations in our server - our Sophie AI will be shortlisting Players\

Q: Wen mint?

A: Soon ser. Likely end July / early August.
